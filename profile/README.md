# 👋 Welcome!
CRK is dedicated to promoting ethical, humane treatment of roosters through voluntary pledges and shared standards.

# 🐓 The CRK Mission

Roosters face unique challenges in backyard flocks and breeding operations at every scale. Unlike hens, multiple roosters often can't be kept together, leading to difficult decisions about "surplus" males. We believe roosters deserve compassionate care throughout their lives and being humanely dispatched if medically necessary or they're meant to feed/sustain families, rather than placed in a potentially harmful environment to avoid dispatching all-together.

# 🌱 Why They Deserve Your Pledge

**Every** rooster deserves a good life, whether they live as flock protectors or provide nourishment for families. By choosing compassionate care over convenience, we can create a better alternative to factory farming and show that ethical animal husbandry is possible at any scale.

# 📜 The Pledges
We offer two complementary pledges for different roles in rooster care. These voluntary pledges serve as a public symbol of someone's commitment to the ethical standards outlined within them.


## 🏠 [Compassionate Rooster Keeper Pledge](./pledges/keeper-pledge.md)
 - For backyard flock owners, small-scale farmers, and anyone caring for roosters.
 - This pledge covers standards for housing, handling, health care, and ethical decision-making about surplus roosters

## 🥚 [Compassionate Rooster Breeder Pledge](./pledges/breeder-pledge.md)
- For those actively breeding chickens. 
- Includes additional standards around responsible breeding practices
- Also covers genetic health, planning to minimize surplus roosters, and ensuring proper care or food use for males that can't be kept

# ✅ Taking the Pledge

## These are voluntary, self-reported pledges.
There's no formal certification or inspection process - just a commitment to following ethical standards and being part of a community that values compassionate rooster care.

### Benefits of taking a pledge (or pledges):
- Join a community of like-minded rooster guardians. Connect with others that want to give roosters and cockerels humane care and husbandry
- Use "Compassionate Rooster Keeper" or "Compassionate Rooster Breeder" as part of your brand/identity
- Help promote ethical alternatives to factory farming
- (roadmapped) Access to resources and best practices
